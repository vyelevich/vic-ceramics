## 🏺 About My Work

I create hand-made pottery inspired by movement, nature, and simple moments — from everyday mugs and bowls to sculptural ceramics.  
Each piece reflects a blend of functional design and personal expression.

My work focuses on:
* Organic forms and texture
* Earth-inspired glazes
* Practical pieces with a soulful touch
